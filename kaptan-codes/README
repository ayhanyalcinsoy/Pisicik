Building & Installation
-----------------------
* Build Kaptan without installing to your system:

    python2 setup.py build

* Running Kaptan after building:

    python2 build/kaptan.py

* Build and install Kaptan to your system:

    python2 setup.py install


Testing (for Developers)
------------------------
* Build and run the source in a seperate dir:

    ./go


Translations
------------
* To regenerate the translation template, ‘po/kaptan.pot’ (for developers, requires `intltool` from core):

    python2 setup.py update_messages

  Don’t forget to upload this template to Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/chakra-project/resource/kapudan/

  If you plan on releasing a new version of the software shortly, you should post an announcement at
  https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/chakra-project/announcements/ asking translators to update Kaptan translations
  as soon as possible.

* To retrieve the latest translations (give translators at least two weeks since the last time you uploaded a modified
  POT file to Transifex):

    tx pull -af --minimum-perc=90

  Note: You need to install the Transifex client (‘transifex-client’) first. You will also need to have a Transifex
  account and configure your credentials in the ‘~/.transifexrc’ file as described in
  http://support.transifex.com/customer/portal/articles/1000855-configuring-the-client

  If asked to change the host URL in the command line (.net/.com issue), answer ‘n’.

* To edit translations (for translators):
    
    Open the correct .po file for your language in Lokalize, and
    correct/add the translated strings. Then save the file, and submit a
    merge request on Gitorious (if you use git), or mail it to george at
    chakra-project dot org.
