        <Summary xml:lang="tr">simple GUI to control the various Xfce4 WM tweaks that are not available via the "Window Manager Tweaks" control panel.</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="tr">These settings are available via the xconf settings editor but that is one of the most awkward GUI's I  have ever used as you have to select the xfwm4 channel, expand the tree, scroll to the option you want, select it, click edit, change the setting and click save, then the tree gets collapsed and you have to start again!
So this nice simple GUI to control the composite manager, the settings are self explanatory.</Description>
